## Environment Setup

Our codebase is based on MMDetection. Parts of the code is borrowed from [MMTracking](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmtracking) and [Video K-Net](https://github.com/lxtGH/Video-K-Net). We add mmdet by default.

- MIM >= 0.1.1
- MMCV-full == v1.6.1 # be sure that you should install the right version of complied CUDA. 
- timm
- scipy
- panopticapi

Or any missing packages, you should pip install manually.
